# chromosome map

###This script is a modification of chromosome_diagram.py (https://github.com/peterjc/pico_galaxy/tree/master/tools/chromosome_diagram) by Peter J Cock. 

This python code will generate chromosome maps that shows physical coordinates and map distance. To use this script you will need to provide the following:
-d, --directory = path to the directory that contains files 
-i, --input_file = This file contains a list of files for each chromosome 
-o, --output_file = The name of the output files (PDF format)
-t, --title = Title for your chromosome map

e.g., python chromsome_map_new.py -d pathtoyourfolder -i pathtoyourfolder/map_file.txt -o pathtoyourfolder/chromsome_map.pdf -t "Chromosomes"


#To do:
Add examples and more explanation.
